Implementation of Ad-Hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing Protocol in VANETs Network on JL. Jend. Sudirman Purwokerto
Description
This project aims to implement the Ad-Hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol in VANETs (Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks), applied in the area of JL. Jend. Sudirman, Purwokerto. VANETs allow vehicles to communicate with each other and with Road Side Units (RSUs) to improve safety and transportation efficiency.

Project Goals
Implementing AODV in VANETs for routing data between vehicles and RSUs.

Calculating the End-to-End Delay, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), and Throughput generated by the VANETs network using the AODV protocol.

Providing configuration options to adjust the vehicle speed and number of nodes in the simulation to observe their effects on network performance.

Displaying the messages transmitted between vehicles and RSUs within the network.

Features
Configurable Speed and Number of Nodes: Users can configure the number of vehicles and their speeds to simulate different scenarios in the network.

Performance Measurement: Simulation outputs include End-to-End Delay, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), and Throughput, providing insights into the network performance based on the configured parameters.

Message Transmission: The simulation also displays the messages successfully sent and received by RSUs (Road Side Units) to ensure efficient communication between vehicles and infrastructure.

Location and Mapping: The simulation location is set in the JL. Jend. Sudirman area, Purwokerto, reflecting the real-world use of VANETs in an urban area.

Simulation Outputs
End-to-End Delay: The time it takes to send data from one node to another through the network.

Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR): The ratio of successfully delivered packets compared to the lost packets during transmission.

Throughput: The amount of data successfully sent per unit of time, measuring the network's efficiency.
